# ExamPass Assistant

**Turn lecture slides into exam-ready study materials.**

> [中文](./README.md)

### What is this

An AI-powered exam prep assistant. Drop in your lecture PPTs, Word handouts, or PDF readings — it generates:

- **Knowledge Guides** — structured review notes with perfect formula rendering, priority labels, and table-of-contents navigation
- **Interactive Quizzes** — answer online, one-click grading, per-question explanations with common mistake warnings

Open in any browser. No PDF engine needed. Formulas rendered by MathJax. Ctrl+P to print.

### Why

The universal pain of finals week: scattered lecture files, no idea what's actually on the exam, no reliable practice questions.

ExamPass reads your course materials with Claude → extracts key points → generates quizzes → grades them. Students use it to study smarter. Instructors use it to create exercises and assignments in seconds.

### Supported Formats

PPTX · DOCX · PDF (with image recognition via multimodal analysis)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/exampass.git
cd exampass
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)**:
- Windows: `winget install pandoc`
- Mac: `brew install pandoc`
- Linux: `sudo apt install pandoc`

### Usage

**Generate chapter study materials** — run `/exampass` in any course directory. The skill scans subfolders, groups files by chapter, extracts all content, and outputs knowledge guides + interactive quizzes into each folder.

**Generate a final exam** — run `/exampass-final` in the course root. Configure difficulty, duration, and question distribution. The skill reads all chapter content and produces a comprehensive exam with answer key.

**Use in your own code**:

```python
from scripts.template_engine import save_knowledge_html, save_test

# Knowledge guide — pass HTML body directly, no Markdown/Pandoc needed
body_html = '''
<h2>1. Sequence Modeling Basics</h2>
<h3>1.1 Sequence Data</h3>
<p>Sequence data is characterized by <strong>ordered elements</strong>...</p>
<table><tr><th>N</th><th>Name</th></tr>...</table>
<blockquote>Key point: Beam search is a heuristic method</blockquote>
'''
save_knowledge_html(body_html, 'output.html', 'Chapter 15')

# Interactive quiz — pass question data, get a clickable self-grading page
questions = [
    {"type": "choice", "points": 2,
     "question": "What is the core function of a language model?",
     "options": ["Translation", "Estimating sentence probability",
                 "Tokenization", "Object recognition"],
     "answer": 1,
     "explanation": "A language model computes P(w1,...,wT)...",
     "pitfall": "Don't confuse language models with translation systems."},
]
save_test(questions, 'quiz.html', 'Chapter Quiz', '100 points total')
```

### How It Works

1. **Scan & Group** — recursively finds all PPTX/DOCX/PDF files, groups by parent folder (one chapter per folder)
2. **Extract** — pulls text, tables, and embedded images from each file
3. **Analyze** — Claude reads the content, identifies key concepts, formulas, solution methods, and exam-relevant patterns
4. **Generate** — Claude outputs HTML body directly (no Markdown/Pandoc needed); templates wrap it into a styled page with MathJax and interactive quiz logic
